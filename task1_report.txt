Report on Fine-tuning TTS for English with a Focus on Technical Vocabulary

1. Model Selection
Base Model: Coqui TTS Vits model.
Reason for Selection: The Vits model is flexible, has high-quality multi-speaker synthesis, 
and can generate natural-sounding speech. Its architecture supports handling both general English and technical terms.

2. Dataset Collection
Dataset Used: Transcriptions from the "Software Engineering Daily" podcasts.
Reason for Selection: These podcasts contain discussions on various technical topics, 
which include many key terms and acronyms like "API," "OAuth," "CUDA," and "TTS." 
This makes it an ideal dataset for fine-tuning the model to improve pronunciation accuracy of technical vocabulary.

3. Fine-tuning Process
Hyperparameters:
Learning Rate: 0.0001.
Batch Size: 8.

4. Benchmarks
Despite losses for discriminator and generator being low, the model's performance on technical vocabulary is bad, in my opinion. 
PESQ is 2.5, and the model is unable to pronounce many technical terms correctly.
However it performs better on some terms like 'OAuth', 'DS & ML', 'API', 'TTS', 'CUDA', 'GPU', 'CPU', 'GPU' compared to the base model
