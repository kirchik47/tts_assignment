Report on Fine-tuning TTS for Polish Language

1. Model Selection
Base Model: Coqui TTS Vits model.
Reason for Selection: The Vits model is flexible, has high-quality multi-speaker synthesis, 
and can generate natural-sounding speech. The only problem is that it doesn't have a Polish phonemes converter, so I needed
to do the phoneme creation using phonemizer lib.

2. Dataset Collection
Dataset Used: Transcriptions from the CommonVoice audios.
Reason for Selection: These audios contain sentences on various topics, and is one of not many rich datasets with Polish language.

3. Fine-tuning Process
Hyperparameters:
Learning Rate: 0.0005.
Batch Size: 8.

4. Benchmarks
Losses for discriminator and generator being low, the model's performance on Polish text is pretty decent. I've asked several 
native speakers to evaluate the model's quality, and they've said it's good enough for a first
attempt. However, there are some issues with the model's ability to generate speech with a natural rhythm
and intonation. This is likely due to the limited size of the dataset and the model's architecture.
PESQ is 3.43, which is a good score for a first attempt.

It performs a lot better than base model, which has PESQ of 2.9.
